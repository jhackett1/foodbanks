# Foodbanks

Foodbank users can sign up, set a shopping list. Everyone else can search for their nearest donation point and see the shopping list.

## Running it locally

You need ruby installed.

1. Clone the repo and `bundle install`
2. Setup the database with `rails db:schema:load`
3. Seed the food items with `rails db:seed`
